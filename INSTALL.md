Installation Instructions
=========================

GTK+ 3
------

To install RapidLauncher you will need to have GTK+ 3 and its Vala
bindings installed.

On Ubuntu (12.04) these packages are called:

* ``gir1.2-gtk-3.0``
* ``libgtk-3-dev``


Building
---------------

When you have all dependencies installed simply run the install.sh script,
which will interactively ask you for your requirements, set the environment
variables accordingly and run *make*.

``$ make``  
``$ sudo make install``


Usage
-----

Once you have installed RapidLauncher you can start it with the
'rapidlauncher' command or by using the included .desktop file.

You probably want to bind the ``rapidlauncher`` command to a keyboard
shortcut.
